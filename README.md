## My process

I started this project with a very basic level of JavaScript, I programed with Java so the change wasn't very heavy. I encounter some problems with the DOM manipulation but I think I managed to fix them and give the page a good and interactive look.

I also run into a problem with the inputs and low res devices which I didn't manage to fix, if someone could help me I would be soo happy <3.

I used a mobile first aproach and then expanded the design to a desktop view.
